# The Journal

An editorial blog and online magazine called "The Journal" with the subtitle "Essays on Design, Culture, and the Quiet Life."

This is a study in typographic restraint. No gradients, no animations, no JavaScript. Just carefully chosen fonts, generous whitespace, and content that breathes. Inspired by publications like Monocle, Kinfolk, and Cereal Magazine.

## What's Here

A multi-page blog with:

- **Minimal navigation** with "The Journal" wordmark and category links (Essays, Culture, Design, About)
- **Featured hero article** with large photography ("The Architecture of Silence")
- **Article grid** with image cards covering topics like wabi-sabi, light photography, and mountain landscapes
- **Individual post pages** (5 articles) with full-length content
- **Separate stylesheet** with an 8px spacing grid system and extensive CSS custom properties

## Design Choices

Playfair Display and Inter on warm off-white with earth-tone accents. Every spacing value snaps to an 8px grid. The entire design philosophy is about deliberate restraint. There's no hero animation, no scroll effect, no hover state that draws attention to itself. The content is the interface. If you removed the text and images, there would be nothing left, and that's the point.

## Tech

HTML + CSS. No framework. No JavaScript. No build step. The `style.css` file is the most interesting part, with its systematic custom property architecture defining every spacing, color, and typographic value.
