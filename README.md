# The Journal

No JavaScript. No framework. No build step. Two files that matter: `index.html` and `style.css`.

The Journal is an editorial blog on design, culture, and the quiet life -- inspired by Monocle, Kinfolk, and Cereal Magazine. A featured hero article ("The Architecture of Silence"), an article grid below it, and five full-length posts. Playfair Display paired with Inter, warm off-white background, 8px spacing grid governing every margin and gap.

Open `style.css`. That's the interesting part. The custom property architecture is systematic enough to feel like a design token API -- colors, type scales, spacing, all declared once and referenced everywhere. The entire visual identity lives in roughly a dozen variables. Change them and the whole publication changes character.

The design philosophy is deliberate restraint. If you stripped out the text and images, there would be nothing left on screen -- no decorative elements, no gradients, no shadows, no visual tricks. The typography and whitespace are doing all of the work, and that's the point.

Eight files total. Runs by opening `index.html` in a browser.
